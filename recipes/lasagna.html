            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
                    <li>Heat olive oil a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot pot with onion, garlic, oregano, and basil until beef is completely browned, 5 to 10 minutes. 
                        Stir spaghetti sauce and spinach into ground beef mixture; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir ricotta cheese, 8 ounces mozzarella cheese, parsley, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.</li>    
                    <li>Spread a small amount of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan. Arrange lasagna noodles in a single layer over sauce. 
                        Spread another layer of sauce over top and arrange another layer of lasagna noodles over sauce. Spread 1/2 the remaining sauce and 1/2 the cheese mixture over top. 
                        Repeat layers, finishing with sauce. Cover the pan with aluminum foil.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 55 minutes, remove the aluminum foil, sprinkle lasagna with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, and bake until noodles are cooked through and sauce is bubbling, 
                        about 15 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>    
                </ol>
